HeavyHitter is an implementation of a probabilistic counter of the top N most frequently appearing items in a stream of items.

A good example of uses for this sort of data structure is keeping track of the top N most frequently purchased items from a large catalog of items where keeping track of a map of items and frequency counts isn't tenable because of the size of the catalog.
